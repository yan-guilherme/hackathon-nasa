### Minimal Angular.js app

Angular Starter is a minimal [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) HTML5 application to get your web app project started. The main goal of this project is to provide the basic structure for **Angular.js** projects with preconfigured **testing** and **Continuous Integration** setup.

### How minimal?
- Angular Starter application has 3 minimal pages with navigation between them.
- Angular Starter application has a defined structure with separated controllers and views.
- Angular Started application has few simple examples of Angular.js app http communication with Restful APIs.
- Angular Starter application has unit and end 2 end tests configured so you can dive into TDD and BDD haven.
- Angular Starter application has Continuous Integration configured to perfrom testing on every GitHub code push. Its like having an additional QA team member!
- That's all!
